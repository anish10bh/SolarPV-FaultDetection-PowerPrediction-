# SolarPV-FaultDetection-PowerPrediction

This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict power output and classify faults in solar PV panels. It uses real-world voltage, current, temperature, and environmental sensor data collected from a PV system.

## 🌞 Project Objectives

- Predict solar panel power output using regression models.
- Classify panel faults due to:
  - Dust accumulation (Low, Medium, High)
  - Shading or obstruction (P1 to P8)
  - Abnormal operating conditions (voltage/current drop)
- Evaluate model performance using real sensor data.
